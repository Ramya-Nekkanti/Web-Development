<p>In our college canteen, we have a system where we still need to go to the canteen to order food.
From the menu displayed on the screen, we need to pick up and pay for the order confirmation.
We have found this system tedious and thought of automating it as it greatly helps everyone during busy hours. This is the main motive of our “Online Canteen food ordering system”. This system greatly reduces the time and simplifies the ordering process for both the Customer and the canteen. When coming to the implementation details, we have 3 modules in this project, such as the admin module, the User module, and the staff module. Admin module has the functionalities such as adding new food items, providing combo offers, enabling, or disabling the food items based on their availability and updating the delivery status of food. Registered users can access the website with their valid credentials. Users can search for different food.</p>
